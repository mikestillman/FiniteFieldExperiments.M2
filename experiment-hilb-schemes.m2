-- Idea:
--  fix a hilbert polynomial.
--  fix a monomial ideal
--  sample points on the Hilbert scheme "near" this point.

-- random tangent vector in Hom(I, S/I)_0
-- lift it to order 2, if possible. (linear question)
-- if it works (up to order, e.g. 5).  Count how many we find, use this to estimate codim of components, and # of components.
-- (basically: how many components does the tangent cone have?)
